# Quiz Management System

This is a **Quiz Management System** developed using **Jakarta EE** (a powerful Java-based framework for enterprise applications), along with **HTML** and **CSS** for the frontend. This system allows users to create, manage, and attend quizzes easily and securely.

## 🌐 Technologies Used

- **Jakarta EE (Java)** — Backend logic and server-side handling.
- **HTML** — Page structure and content.
- **CSS** — Styling and layout.

## 📌 Features

### For Users:
- ✅ Simple login with **username**, **password**, and **email ID**.
- ✅ Access to multiple quizzes based on different **topics** or **subjects**.
- ✅ Instant result after quiz completion.
- ✅ **Auto-generated certificate** sent directly to the user’s **email** after completing the quiz.

### For Admin:
- 🛠️ Create and manage multiple quizzes simultaneously.
- 🛠️ Add, edit, or remove questions dynamically.
- 🛠️ Categorize questions based on subject or topic.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Registration/Login**:
   - Users can log in using their email, username, and password.
   - After logging in, they can view and attend available quizzes.

2. **Quiz Attempt**:
   - Quizzes are listed by subject or topic.
   - Users attend quizzes and submit their answers.

3. **Certificate Generation**:
   - Upon successful completion, the system generates a **certificate**.
   - The certificate is emailed automatically to the user.

4. **Admin Panel**:
   - Admin can manage quizzes.
   - Add or remove questions based on current requirements.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project was created to:
- Demonstrate enterprise-level application development with **Jakarta EE**.
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for both **quiz takers** and **quiz creators**.
- Automate the quiz-to-certificate process using email integration.
